Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile! You might notice that my recent commit history shows little to no activity since December 2022. This is because, starting from that time, the company where I work transitioned to using Azure DevOps for source control and version management. As a result, I no longer used GitHub for work-related projects after that switch.

However, prior to the transition to Azure, I was actively contributing to projects on GitHub as a frontend developer at Wonderkind (since December 2020). You can find the majority of my work and contributions within the commit history up until that point. I am still continuing to contribute to projects, but now primarily through Azure DevOps.
